This is bum - version 0.1-alpha
===============================

What is bum?
------------
bum is a package manager front end for RPM written in bash. It is a 
"function-alike" clone of yum (YellowDog Updater Modified). This is mostly 
written for fun and educational purposes and is not meant to really be used by 
anyone as a replacement for yum as yum is currently, and likely to always be, 
far superior in performance and feature completeness.

Why on earth?
-------------
It started as a joke in #rhel on irc.freenode.net and then a small group of us
thought it would be fun to actually implement because there's a lot that we 
could learn about RPM transactions, dependencies, and other good information
from taking the joke just a little too far. Also, I'm pretty sure we're going
to excercise and hopefully improve our bash-fu along the way.

What can it do?
---------------
Nothing yet ... :X

The goal is to do everything that yum can but that's a lofty goal so first run
will attempt to implement the following:
    - update/upgrade packages
    - install packages with automatic dependency resolution
    - groupinstall packages with automatic dependency resolution
    - remove packages
