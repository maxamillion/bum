The following is the style guide for the bash code in bum.

== Rules ==
- Tabs should be 4 spaces in length
- Code blocks should always be tab intented
- No line is to be longer than 80 characters in length, ever.
- Functions will be named with a leading "fn_" for function call notation
- Namespaces .... we can't really have them (or I can't sort out an elegant 
  solution to them yet, so comments for where things are from would be nice)
- If return values are needed from functions, a "special" variable will be used
  known as __return__ and functions that will return a value should always unset
  this variable as the opening statement of the function.

Everything else not overriden in the previous section will follow:

The style document linked above should be available in the local git repo
